#react-dom-stream

This library is used for rendering markup that's been generated by react-dom-stream-server. It has just one method, `render`:

```javascript
React.render(<SomeElement prop1={value}/>, domElement, hash);
```

The only difference between this `render` method and the `render` method from React is the `hash` argument, which is returned from `react-dom-stream-server`'s `renderToStream` method. The hash is required to make sure that the server-generated markup is the same as the client-rendered markup; if you do not include the hash, React will blow away the server-generated markup.
